Provides 3d primitives that either implement {@link plot3d.rendering.Drawable} or 
{@link plot3d.rendering.Composite3d}, and thus provide a draw() and transform() function 
for the {@link plot3d.rendering.Scene}.
<p>
Some Drawable may also be {@link plot3d.rendering.Wireframeable3d} to offer wireframe
display control on 3d objects for which it make sense: Polygons, Spheres, etc. A Point
has obviously no existing wireframe mode.
<p>
Pure Drawable are implicitely considered as Primitive shapes and provide a function for
drawing themself. A Composite3d may encapsulate several Primitives and delegate rendering
or transformation to its Primitives.
<p>
When designing a Composite3d, the programer must be aware that no real SceneGraph is currently
available, and that the glscale, glrotate and gltransform calls must be set statically into 
the draw function of the Composite3d.
